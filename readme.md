# Simple CRUD Application with TDD

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The aim is to enhance skills in writing unit and integration tests and improve system design capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Angular 15
- **Database**: H2 Database
- **Testing Tools**:
    - JUnit (for Java unit testing)
    - Jasmine and Karma (for Angular unit and integration testing)

## Setup
### Environment Setup:
- Install Java, Node.js, and Angular CLI.
- Set up an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code).

### Project Initialization:
- Initialize a Git repository.
- Create a new Spring Boot project.
- Set up an Angular 15 project.

## Development Plan
### Week 1: Setup and Planning
- **Days 1-3**: Environment setup and project initialization.
- **Days 4-7**: Application planning, defining data models, and user stories.

### Weeks 2-3: Implementing CRUD Operations
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then the implementation.
- Start with backend development and then proceed to frontend.

### Week 4: Refinement and Additional Features
- Enhance the application with additional features and UI improvements.

## Goals
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% coverage.
- **Functionality**: Support all CRUD operations.
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards using static code analysis tools.

## Contribution
- Commit changes daily to track progress.
- Review and adjust plans weekly.
